# Patient Management System Project in Laravel

This project is a PHP and Laravel Framework-based Patient Records Management System. This system is in charge of managing and keeping patient records in a certain hospital. The data is stored in a database, such as a patient’s Out-Patient Findings and Admission Details. A hospital may readily get the data or records of their patients using this method. This Patient Records Management System has a pleasant user interface and user-friendly functionalities to provide users with a better system experience.

The Patient Management System is a web-based program. This program is an information system that hospitals and clinics use to manage and save their data in a simple and efficient manner. It has a variety of functions and characteristics. The primary benefit is the ability to keep records obtained in the hospital. It provides unique features, such as assisting in the storage of records and registering patients and inpatients.
